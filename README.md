A project in Principles of Software Engineering, that includes a Django app and all the neccessary documentation for a software project. The documentation is in Serbian.<br>
The Django app is a song lyric guessing game named 'Blank Space' (you need to fill out the missing lyrics). The team members came up with the theme and all the features.<br>
The project was done in a team of 4 students, and in 7 phases, throughout the whole semester. This is the overview of the phases:<br>
1) Coming up with the main aspects of the app and the use cases. The final version of the main description of all the features can be found in the folder projektni_zadatak.<br>
2) Writing the use case documents and making the prototype in HTML (the prototype was used as frontend in the implementation phase, with a few adjustments). These can be found in the folder ssu and prototip.<br>
3) Formal inspection. This was done for another team's project, and all the documentation can be found in the folder formalna_inspekcija. This project was inspected by another team, and all the errors found were fixed after this phase.<br>
4) Database modelling. The specifications and the sql script for creating the database can be found in the folder baza.<br>
5) Implementation. This is a multiplayer game, and it uses a MySql database. All the files can be found in the folder project.<br>
6) Modelling. The class, use-case and multiple sequence diagrams can be found in modelovanje.<br>
7) Testing. The unit tests, Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver tests can be found in the folder tests withing the Django app.<br>
It was very important that the workload was spread evenly across the team members, so the detailed description of that for each phase is in the presentation in prezentacija aplikacije.<br>
Git was used all throughout the project development (a version of Gerrit).
